To run the code:

1)Create a folder 'fast transfer' in your gdrive.
(You could name it whatever, but then you'll have to ensure you're changing the code in the notebook for the directory correctly)

2)Download one of the Style Checkpoints from the links above

3)Run the first 5 cells in the notebook. Then navigate to the directory 'fast-style-transfer' which should be inside 'fast transfer' in your drive

4)Upload the downloaded checkpoint, and an image which you would like to transfer to a different style

5)Run the remaining cells of the notebook

At the end of it, you should be able to find the output image in 'fast-style-transfer' directory in your drive.
